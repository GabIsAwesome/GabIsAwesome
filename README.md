# About me!
Hi there. I am not interesting... at all. I know a *little* bit than I should about PHP, HTML, JS and CSS. I know how to do web development, and I do learn PHP and more in my free time as a hobby and I've made various projects envolving PHP.

I love debugging games, not only debugging them but learning about how they work internally. Mainly `Splatoon (1 and 3)`, but also other games...
I like reverse engineering stuff, too!

I have little to no experience on Python, Node.js and other languages but I am still trying to improve!
